Developed a real-time face mask detection system using Python and OpenCV, leveraging deep learning-based computer vision techniques. The system employs a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model integrated with OpenCV for face detection and mask classification. It uses Haar cascades or the DLIB library for robust facial region extraction from video streams. Mask presence is classified with high accuracy through a CNN trained on a labeled dataset of masked and unmasked faces. The solution is optimized for real-time performance and scalability, making it ideal for deployment in public spaces, workplaces, and healthcare facilities to ensure compliance with safety protocols.
