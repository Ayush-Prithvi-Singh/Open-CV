Developed an advanced image processing application in Python leveraging OpenCV for real-time photo-to-pencil sketch transformation. The system utilizes Gaussian blurring and edge-detection algorithms to extract structural details and enhance edge contrast, achieving a realistic pencil sketch effect. Image intensity gradients and adaptive thresholding techniques are employed to simulate hand-drawn strokes, preserving the fine details and textures of the original image. The pipeline supports high-resolution image processing and is optimized for efficient computation, making it suitable for both static images and video frames.
