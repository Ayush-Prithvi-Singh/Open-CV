Developed an automated license plate recognition (ALPR) system utilizing Python and OpenCV to process real-time camera feeds. The system integrates advanced image processing techniques, including edge detection, morphological operations, and contour analysis, to accurately localize license plates within frames. Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is applied to extract alphanumeric characters from the plates using pre-trained text recognition models. The pipeline is robust against varying lighting conditions, camera angles, and motion artifacts, ensuring high recognition accuracy. The project is optimized for real-time deployment in traffic monitoring, parking management, and law enforcement applications.
